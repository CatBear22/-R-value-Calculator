# -R-value-Calculator
Are you prepared for your next outdoor adventure? Calculate the R value of your gear to see if you are. 


Quick outdoor insulation calculator (web, Python CLI/Streamlit, and React components).

Files:
- `index.html` — single-file web app (static)
- `rvalue_calculator_v2.py` — CLI + Streamlit interactive app
- `RValueCalculatorReact_v2.js` — React component (Tailwind recommended)

Seeded pad R-values (examples):
- Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm — R ≈ 5.7
- Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite — R ≈ 4.2
- NEMO Tensor All-Season — R ≈ 5.4
- Sea to Summit UltraLight — R ≈ 3.1
- Therm-a-Rest Trail Pro — R ≈ 4.4

Notes:
- All inputs must be the same R units (ft²·°F·hr/BTU). Clothing often uses **clo**; convert before entry.
- Weather adjustments are conservative heuristics for planning.
